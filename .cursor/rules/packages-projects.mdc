# Package Managers

These rules define which package and project managers to use for various languages and frameworks, and any caveats or exceptions that may apply.

## Languages and frameworks

### JavaScript and TypeScript

Use the `bun` package manager for JavaScript and TypeScript projects. When writing scripts for example in `package.json`, use `bun run` instead of just bare `bun` to be specific.

### Python

Use the `uv` tool to initialise Python projects and manage them. Migrate to `uv` where possible. Ensure that the package definitions use manager-nonspecific directives where possible, and `uv`-specific directives where not and the file can't be restructured to use generic directives.
